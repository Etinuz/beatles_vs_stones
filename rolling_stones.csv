In the winter when the cold comes 
 And the wind blows with a scornful spite 
 And the hard ground feels barren 
 And the forest is deathly quiet 
 And the whole world lies sleeping 
 There`s a gypsy all dressed in white 
 Put my hand out, ask the question 
 Here`s the silver, do you have the gift of sight 
 
 Can you break the spell 
 Can you ring the bell 
 Can you break the spell 
 It`s cold black as night 
 I`ve got a hard heart 
 Since we`ve been apart 
 Can you break the spell 
 Break it all down tonight 
 
 In the springtime when the floods come 
 And the earth bursts with the terrible life 
 And the sun splash on the windows 
 There`s a gypsy and he`s all dressed in white 
 My heart burns with the question 
 Can you break the spell 
 Still hot as fire 
 
 Can you break the spell 
 Can you ring the bell 
 Can you break the spell 
 It`s cold black as night 
 Cold black as night

 Well, I heard so much about London
 I decided to check it out 
 
 Well, I wait in Leicester Square

 Oh where can I get my cock sucked?
 Where can I get my ass fucked?
 I may have no money,
 But I know where to put it every time 
 
 Well, I asked a young policeman
 If he`d only lock me up for the night
 Well, I`ve had pigs in the farmyard,
 Some of them, some of them, they`re alright
 Well, he fucked me with his truncheon
 And his helmet was way too tight

 Found myself when I stopped yawnin`, started

 Then I felt I had a dream, I remembered the
 things I`d seen
 I could still hear the things you said with that bad
 dream in my head
 It was a sad day, bad day, sad day, bad day
 
 So I called you on the phone and your friend said
 ""she`s not home""
 So I told her where I`d be at and that you should
 call me back
 Then I looked at the morning mail, I was not even
 expecting a bill
 Your letter a-started ""Dear"", and it left me
 with these tears.
 It was a sad day, bad day, sad day, bad day 
 
 Think of the times that we had rows, but we
 patched them up somehow
 Think of the times I tried to go, but you screamed
 and told me no
 There is only one thing in this world that I can`t
 understand, that`s a girl

 Loving you so physically

There's a tramp sittin' on my doorstep

Tryin' to waste his time

With his methylated sandwich

He's a walking clothesline

And here comes the bishop's daughter

On the other side

She looks a trifle jealous

She's been an outcast all her life

Me, I'm waiting so patiently

Lying on the floor

I'm just trying to do my jig-saw puzzle

Before it rains anymore

Oh the gangster looks so fright'ning

With his luger in his hand

When he gets home to his children

He's a family man

But when it comes to the nitty-gritty

He can shove in his knife

Yes he really looks quite religious

He's been an outlaw all his life

Me, I'm waiting so patiently

Lying on the floor

I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle

Before it rains anymore

Me, I'm waiting so patiently

Lying on the floor

I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle

Before it rains anymore

Oh the singer, he looks angry

At being thrown to the lions

And the bass player, he looks nervous

About the girls outside

And the drummer, he's so shattered

Trying to keep up time

And the guitar players look damaged

They've been outcasts all their lives

Me, I'm waiting so patiently

Lying on the floor

I'm just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle

Before it rains anymore

Oh, there's twenty-thousand grandmas

Wave their hankies in the air

All burning up their pensions

And shouting, ""It's not fair!""

There's a regiment of soldiers

Standing looking on

And the queen is bravely shouting,

""What the hell is going on?""

With a blood-curdling ""tally-ho""

She charged into the ranks

And blessed all those grandmas who

With their dying breaths screamed, ""Thanks!""

Me, I'm just waiting so patiently

With my woman on the floor

We're just trying to do this jig-saw puzzle

 Till the next time we say goodbye 
 I`ll be thinking of you 
 I`ll be thinking of you 
 
 Yeah, a movie house on Forty-Second Street 
 Ain`t a very likely place for you and I to meet 
 Watching the snow swirl around your hair and around your feet 
 And I`m thinking to myself she surely looks a treat 
 Till the next time we say goodbye

 Till the next time that we kiss goodnight 
 I`ll be thinking of you

 I can`t go on like this, can ya? Can ya? 
 I can`t go on like this, can ya? 
 
 You give me a cure all from New Orleans 
 Now that`s a recipe I sure do need 
 Some cider vinegar and some elderberry wine 
 May cure all your ills, but it can`t cure mine 
 Your Lou`siana recipes have let me down 
 Your Lou`siana recipes have surely let me down 
 Till the next time we say goodbye 
 Drink to it 
 Till the next time we say goodbye 
 Till the next time that we kiss goodnight 
 Till the next time we say goodbye 
 Till the next time we say goodbye 
 Till the next time that we kiss goodnight

Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow

 I`m glad I opened your eyes 
 The have-nots have tried to freeze you in ice 
 
 Have you seen your brother, baby, standing in the shadow 
 Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow 
 I was just passing the time 
 I`m all alone, won`t you give all your sympathy to mine 
 
 Tell me a story about how you adore me 
 Live in the shadow, see through the shadow, 
 Live through the shadow, tear at the shadow 
 Hate in the shadow, and love in your shadowy life 
 
 Have you seen your lover, baby, standing in the shadow 
 Has he had another baby, standing in the shadow 
 Baby, where have you been all your life 
 Talking about all the people who should try anything twice 
 
 Have you seen your mother, baby, standing in the shadow 
 Have you had another baby, standing in the shadow 
 You take your choice at this time 
 The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline

Hey girls, you better listen to me 
 I`m getting starved for your company 
 All day Monday, and all day Tuesday 
 I played football, there`s nothing on the telly 
 Now ever since I was just 13 years old 
 Well, I always felt shy but I acted so bold 
 I never had the money and I never had the class 
 But I always seemed to get myself a Saturday night piece of ass! 
 
 Where the boys go, Saturday night 
 Where the boys all go, hold me tight 
 Where the boys all go, Saturday night 
 Where the boys all go 
 
 Saturday morning you can see me at the pub 
 and I`m pissing away me money and I can`t stand up 
 Cab fare, pop? You look silly in the road 
 Get in everybody, where the boys all go! 
 
 Hey! Never keep a secret from meeeee--eeeeeeee 
 Hey! Never keep a secret from yuuuuuuuuuwwwwwww 
 Hey! Never keep a secret from meeeeee-eeeeeee 
 
 Where the boys go, Saturday night 
 Where the boys go, hold me tight 
 Where the boys go, stand around and grope 
 Where the boys go, showing off their clothes 
 Where the boys go, down the disco! 
 
 Hey girls, what you doin` tonight? 
 Now do you want to dance, or do you want to bite? 
 Look here, darlin, I know the score 
 Paint your face, dye your hair, I`ll see you round the back! 
 
 Where the boys go, Saturday night 
 Where the boys go, hold me tight 
 Where the boys go, Saturday night 
 
 Where the boys go, for a giggle and a lawff 
 Where the boys go, and a little piece of ass 
 Where the boys go, for a little piece of this 
 Where the boys go, for a little piece of that 
 Where the boys go, for a little piece of stick! 
 Where the boys go, for a little piece of cunt!

It was an filthy block of flats

Trash was on the floor

The stink was in my nose

Hinges off the door



She took me in her room

All was spick and span

Fixed me up a drink

Turned down all the lamps



And the rain fell down

On the cold hard ground

And the phone kept ringing

And we made sweet love



Why do we live in this strange grey town?

They build it up let it all fall down

Feel like we're all living in a battleground

Everybody's jazzed



Why do we live in this strange grey town?

The paint is peeling and the sky's turned brown

The bankers are wankers every Thursday night

they just vomit on the ground



And the rain fell down

On the cold hard ground

And the phone kept ringing

And we made sweet love

And we made sweet love



Everybody's dreaming

Everybody's screaming



Watching the rain fall down



She cooked me up some eggs

Then she made some tea

Kissed me on the check

Then I turned on her tv



It was usual the crap

All the usual sleaze

For 10.000 quid

Some bimbo spilled the beans



And the rain fell down

On the cold hard ground

And the phone kept ringing

And we made sweet love

I live in an apartment o

n the ninety-ninth floor of my block

And I sit at home looking out the window

Imagining the world has stopped

Then in flies a guy who's all dressed up

like a Union Jack

And says, I've won five pounds

if I have his kind of detergent pack

I said, Hey! You! Get off of my cloud

Hey! You! Get off of my cloud

Hey! You! Get off of my cloud

Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd

On my cloud, baby

The telephone is ringing

I say, ""Hi, it's me. Who is it there on the line?""

A voice says, ""Hi, hello, how are you?""

Well, I guess I'm doin' fine

He says, ""It's three a.m., there's too much noise

Don't you people ever wanna go to bed?

Just 'cause you feel so good, do you have

To drive me out of my head?""

I said, Hey! You! Get off of my cloud

Hey! You! Get off of my cloud

Hey! You! Get off of my cloud

Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd

On my cloud baby

I was sick and tired, fed up with this

And decided to take a drive downtown

It was so very quiet and peaceful

There was nobody, not a soul around

I laid myself out, I was so tired and I started to dream

In the morning the parking tickets were just like

A flag stuck on my window screen

I said, Hey! You! Get off of my cloud

Hey! You! Get off of my cloud

 But we`ve got all the answers, and we`ve got lovely dancers, too 
 There`s nothing else you have to do 
 On with the show good health to you

I stand accused of talking
 But I feel that we are falling
 In the same old groove
 The radio is playing
 Spitting out the same old news 
 
 It`s time to get up, get out
 Get out into something new
 Time to get up, get out
 Out into something new 
 
 Everybody wants somebody`s fantasy
 Everybody wants somebody`s crazy dreams
 Everybody wants somebody`s fantasy
 Everybody wants somebody`s crazy dreams 
 
 If I was a woman, I would want a new man every night
 If I was a woman, I would want a new man every night
 If I was a politician, make sure I was the best in sight
 If I was a woman, I would want a new man every night 
 
 The poor man eyes the rich man
 Denigrates his poverty
 The rich man eyes the poor man
 And envies his simplicity 
 
 Everybody wants somebody`s fantasy
 Everybody wants somebody`s crazy dreams 
 
 If I was a movie star, five million dollars would be my price
 If I was a trucker, I`d drive for seven days and seven lonely
 nights
 If I was a drummer, I would never miss the beat
 If I was a dancer, y`all would never see my feet
 If I was a hooker, a thousand dollars would be my price, all
 right
 If I was a candidate for President, I`d make sure I had a
 steady wife
 If I was a millionaire, I`d spend all my money in one crazy
 night 
 
 I am what I am

 I am what I am
 My dreams can`t be bought
 Yeah, I said now here comes a dollar fifty(?)
 Stranding in New York(?)
 Yeah, I am what I am

Long distance in formation, give me Memphis Tennessee
 Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
 She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
 `Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall 
 
 Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
 She`s the only one who`d phone me here from Memphis Tennessee
 Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
 Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge 
 
 Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
 Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
 But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
 And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee 
 
 Last time I saw Marie she`s waving me good-bye
 With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
 Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee

 Yes, here he`s got it I`m sure
 `Cause he lost his life in an accident
 Found his heart in the man next door
 What exactly`s gonna happen
 When they do transplant the brain
 Will my borrowed brain still compute the same
 Or will my daughter suffer so much more 
 
 Here comes the girl, she`s got her head screwed on
 But it ain`t screwed on right
 Her ambition is to be a prostitute
 But the breaks just weren`t right
 What exactly`s gonna happen, tell me
 When her father finds out
 That his virgin daughter has bordello dreams
 And that he`s the one she wants to try out
 Yeah 
 
 There`s ma, she`s living dangerously
 It`s a cinch she`ll try it anything twice
 She thinks she can run right to the whirlpool`s edge
 And stop herself just in time
 What exactly`s gonna happen
 When she finally fizzles out
 The lovers will just be sucked into
 To see what the colours of death are all about 
 
 Here`s the son, has his legs a-screwed on
 Yeah, they`re screwed on pretty tight
 But his brain is loose and it ain`t no use
 He`s already lost the fight
 What exactly`s gonna happen
 When he`s finally realized
 That he can`t play his guitar like E.G. Jim
 Or write St. Augustine if he tried 
 
 That`s what happens
 When a family finds out
 That they`ve been in orbit now for a thousand years
 And need a thousand more to climb out

Please allow me to introduce myself

I'm a man of wealth and taste

I've been around for a long, long year

Stole many a man's soul and faith

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ

Had his moment of doubt and pain

Made damn sure that Pilate

Washed his hands and sealed his fate



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guess my name

But what's puzzling you

Is the nature of my game



I stuck around St. Petersburg

When I saw it was a time for a change

Killed the czar and his ministers

Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank

Held a general's rank

When the blitzkrieg raged

And the bodies stank



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guess my name, oh yeah

Ah, what's puzzling you

Is the nature of my game, oh yeah



I watched with glee

While your kings and queens

Fought for ten decades

For the gods they made

I shouted out,

""Who killed the Kennedys?""

When after all

It was you and me

Let me please introduce myself

I'm a man of wealth and taste

And I laid traps for troubadours

Who get killed before they reached Bombay



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah

But what's puzzling you

Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah

But what's confusing you

Is just the nature of my game



Just as every cop is a criminal

And all the sinners saints

As heads is tails

Just call me Lucifer

'Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me

Have some courtesy

Have some sympathy, and some taste

Use all your well - learned politesse

Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guessed my name, um yeah

But what's puzzling you



Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down

Woo, who

Oh yeah, get on down

Oh yeah

Oh yeah!

 He split the time the cock`rel crows 
 
 Talkin` about the midnight gambler

 Sighin` down the wind so sadly 
 Listen and you`ll hear him moan

 Coming down your marble hall

 Play it easy, as you go 
 I`m gonna smash down all your plate glass windows 
 Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door!
 
 Did you hear about the midnight rambler 
 He`ll leave his footprints up and down your hall 
 And did you hear about the midnight gambler 
 And did you see me make my midnight call

 I`ll steal your mistress from under your nose 
 I`ll go easy with your cold fanged anger 
 I`ll stick my knife right down your throat, baby

I was driving home early Sunday morning

through Bakersfield

Listening to gospel music

on the colored radio station

And the preacher said, ""You know you always have the

Lord by your side""



And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran

Twenty red lights in his honor

Thank you Jesus, thank you lord



I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late

And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off

She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find

Much to my surprise, there she was sittin in the corner

A little bleary, worse for wear and tear

Was a girl with far away eyes



So if you're down on your luck

And you can't harmonize

Find a girl with far away eyes

And if you're downright disgusted

And life ain't worth a dime

Get a girl with far away eyes



Well the preacher kept right on saying

that all I had to do was send

Ten dollars to the church of the

sacred bleeding heart of Jesus

Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California

And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio

And all my dreams would come true

So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl

Well, you know what kind of eyes she got



So if you're down on your luck

I know you all sympathize

Find a girl with far away eyes

And if you're downright disgusted

And life ain't worth a dime

There`s a new guy in town 
 He`s been dragging around 
 He`s the figure of youth 
 And his eyes are so blue 
 And they`re looking at you 
 So tell me the truth 
 
 Well, well he`s got stories to tell 
 He bites off more than he chews 
 Well, well is he ringing your bell 
 My heart is breaking in two 
 
 And his skin is so fair 
 And it shines like his hair 
 As he stands so aloof 
 With an indolent air 
 And an insolent stare 
 He just shutters the truth 
 
 Well, well is he ringing your bell 
 My heart is breaking in two 
 Well, well he`ll be rotting in hell 
 For playing the devil with you 
 
 It is aready too late 
 No point shutting the gate 
 Have you already swallowed the bait 
 And you`re gone 
 
 As he knocks you down cold 
 As you lose all control 
 To this slip of a youth 
 I see fire in his eyes 
 I see ice in his smile 
 And I`m learning the truth 
 
 Well, well he`s got stories to tell 
 Of love that is long overdue 
 Well, well who is under his spell 
 Is paying the devil his due

Wondering what I`d do when I`m through tonight 

Smoking moping, maybe just hopin` 

Some little girl will pass on by 

Don`t wanna be alone but I love my girl at home 

I remember what she said 

She said, ""My, my, my don`t tell lies, keep fidelity in your head 

My my my, don`t tell lies. When you`re done you should go to bed 

Don`t say hi, like a spider to a fly 

Jump right ahead and you`re dead"" 



Sit up, fed up, low down go round 

Down to the bar at the place I`m at 

Sitting drinking, supereficially thinking 

About the rinsed-out blonde on my left 

Then I said, ""hi"" like a spider to a fly 

Remembering what my little girl said 



She was common, flirty, she looked about thirty 

I would have run away but I was on my own 

She told me later she`s a machine operator 

She said she liked the way I held the microphone 

I said my, my, like the spider to the fly

 Bring your dandelions to blow away 
 Dandelion don`t tell no lies 
 Dandelion will make you wise 
 Tell me if she laughs or cries 
 Blow away dandelion, blow away dandelion

The fields of Eden 
 Are full of trash 
 And if we beg and we borrow and steal 
 We`ll never get it back 
 People are hungry 
 They crowd around 
 And the city gets bigger as the country comes begging to town 
 
 We`re stuck between a rock 
 And a hard place 
 Between a rock and a hard place 
 
 This talk of freedom 
 And human rights 
 Means bullying and private wars and chucking all the dust into our eyes 
 And peasant people 
 Poorer than dirt 
 Who are caught in the crossfire with nothing to lose but their shirts 
 
 Stuck between a rock 
 And a hard place 
 Between a rock and a hard place 
 
 You`d better stop put on a kind face 
 Between a rock and a hard place 
 
 We`re in the same boat 
 On the same sea 
 And we`re sailing south 
 On the same breeze 
 Guiding dream churches 
 With silver spires 
 And our rogue children 
 Are playing loaded dice 
 
 Give me truth now 
 Don`t want no sham 
 I`d be hung drawn and quartered for a sheep just as well as a lamb 
 
 Stuck between a rock 
 And a hard place 
 Between a rock and a hard place 
 You`d better stop 
 Put on a kind face 
 Can`t you see what you`ve done to me

Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl 

Her eyes were hazel 

And her nose were slightly curved 

We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel 

It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well 

It took a starry to steal my breath away 

Down on the water front 

Her hair all drenched in spray 



Hannah baby was a honey of a girl 

Her eyes were hazel 

And her teeth were slightly curved 

She took my guitar and she began to play 

She sang a song to me 

Stuck right in my brain 



You're just a memory of a love 

That used to be 

You're just a memory of a love 

That used to mean so much to me 



She got a mind of her own 

And she use it well 

Well she's one of a kind 

She`s got a mind 

She got a mind of her own 

And she use it mighty fine 



She drove a pick-up truck 

Painted green and blue 

The tires were wearing thin 

She turned a mile or two 

When I asked her where she headed for 

""Back up to Boston, I'm singing in a bar"" 

I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge 

My nerves are shot already 

The road ain't all that smooth 

Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone 

I keep on a feeling that's gnawing in my bones 



You're just a memory of a love 

That used to mean so much to me 

You're just a memory girl 

You're just a sweet memory 

And it used to mean so much to me 

Sha la la la la 



She got a mind of her own 

And she use it well 

Mighty fine, she's one of a kind 



On the seventh day my eyes were all a glaze 

We've been ten thousand miles 

Been in fifteen states 

Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind 

I hit the bottle and hit the sack and cried 

What's all this laughter on the 22nd floor 

It's just some friends of mine 

And they're busting down the door

There've been so many girls that I've known

I've made so many cry

and still I wonder why

Here comes the little girl

I see her walking down the street

She's all by herself

I try and knock her off her feet

But, she'll never break, never break, never break, never break

This heart of stone

Oh, no, no, this heart of stone

What's different about her? I don't really know

No matter how I try I just can't make her cry

Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break

This heart of stone

Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone

Don't keep on looking that some old way

If you try acting sad, you'll only make me glad

Better listen little girl

You go on walking down the street

I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet

'Cause you'll never break, never break, never break, never break

This heart of stone

Oh, no, no, you'll never break this heart of stone darlin

No, no, this heart of stone

You'll never break it darlin

You won't break this heart of stone

Oh no no no

You better go

You better go home

When the one you love is never home

That a woman should be loved that way

But it hurts me so inside

To see you treat me so unkind

Let me hear you say, ""yeah yeah""

Well they're all in my mind

Just to find her out all night

Well I've been crying

I'm gonna stick by her

New York was cold and damp 
 TV is just a blank 
 Looks like another dead end Sunday 
 
 What about an early night 
 Monday never feels so bright 
 Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely 
 
 Who wants to brave the pouring rain 
 For a glass of French champagne? 
 Well grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by 
 
 And she was hot - as she kissed my mouth 
 She was hot - as I wiped her brow 
 She was hot - she pinned me to the ground 
 She was quick - she knew her way around 
 She was hot - as she tore my clothes 
 She was hot - she had no place to go 
 She was hot - on a cold and rainy night 
 
 Detroit was smoky grey 
 Nothing like the good old days 
 Well I got a fever that I`m fighting 
 
 I don`t need your company 
 Leave me in my misery 
 I can take the rebound just like lightning 
 
 And she was hot - in a 50`s dress 
 She was hot - her lips were flashing red 
 I was lost - in her burning flesh 
 I was hot - I was dripping sweat 
 She was hot - in the Detroit snow 
 She was hot - she had no place to go 
 She was hot - on a cold and rainy night 
 
 And she was hot - and I had the blues 
 She was hot - honey, where were you? 
 If you were in my shoes 
 You would be excused 
 She was hot - you can never wait 
 She was hot - never hesitate 
 She was hot - on a cold and rainy night 
 
 I think I`m going off the rails 
 Riding down the pleasure trails 
 I was taking passion where you find it 
 
 Honey when you were young and fresh 
 And you need the touch of your flesh 
 Go take the treasure where you find it 
 
 And she was hot - in the melted snow 
 She was hot - in the molten glow 
 She was hot - she got it in the blood 
 She was hot - like the dam that bursts 
 She was black - she was strong and true 
 She was black - and her eyes were blue 
 She was lost - and she took a chance 
 At just a brief romance 
 
 Down the avenue into the lost bayou 
 Into the tall bamboo, back to the human zoo 
 I wish you all the best, I hope we meet again 
 On a cold Chicago night 
 
 She was hot 
 She was hot 
 She was hot hot hot 
 She was hot hot hot.........

Didn`t I see you down in San Antone on a hot and dusty night? 
 We were eating eggs in Sammy`s when the black man there drew his knife. 
 Aw, you drowned that Jew in Rampton as he washed his sleeveless shirt, 
 You know, that Spanish-speaking gentlemen, the one we all called ""Kurt."" 
 
 Come now, gentleman, I know there`s some mistake. 
 How forgetful I`m becoming, now you fixed your bus`ness straight. 
 
 I remember you in Hemlock Road in nineteen fifty-six. 
 You`re a faggy little leather boy with a smaller piece of stick. 
 You`re a lashing, smashing hunk of man; 
 Your sweat shines sweet and strong. 
 Your organs working perfectly, but there`s a part that`s not screwed on. 
 
 Weren`t you at the Coke convention back on nineteen sixty-five 
 You`re the misbred, grey executive I`ve seen heavily advertised. 
 You`re the great, gray man whose daughter licks policemen`s buttons clean. 
 You`re the man who squats behind the man who works the soft machine. 
 
 Come now, gentleman, your love is all I crave. 
 You`ll still be in the circus when I`m laughing, laughing on my grave. 
 
 When the old men do the fighting and the young men all look on. 
 And the young girls eat their mothers meat from tubes of plasticon. 
 Be wary of these my gentle friends of all the skins you breed. 
 They have a tasty habit - they eat the hands that bleed. 
 
 So remember who you say you are and keep your noses clean. 
 Boys will be boys and play with toys so be strong with your beast. 
 Oh Rosie dear, doncha think it`s queer, so stop me if you please. 
 The baby is dead, my lady said, ""You gentlemen, why you all work for me?""

In your rose pink cadillac

With a needle and a spoon

And another girl to take my pain away

If you want to wreck my life 
 Go ahead my love 
 Tried it once with poison 
 Tried it once with drugs 
 My circulation`s running dry 
 It`s you that drank me up 
 Screwed me down with kindness 
 Suffocating love 
 
 When it comes to fighting 
 Trying to play it rough 
 I will take you twenty rounds 
 I`m just too tough, too tough 
 Too tough, too tough 
 
 Saw you on TV last night 
 In a rerun soap 
 You were young and beautiful 
 Already without hope 
 
 But I don`t think you ever knew 
 What you`ve bitten off 
 But in the end, you spat me out 
 You could not chew me up 
 I`m too tough, too tough 
 Too tough, too tough 
 
 When it comes to fighting 
 Trying to play it rough 
 I will take you twenty rounds 
 I`m just too tough, too tough 
 
 I married yesterday 
 To a teenage bride 
 You said it`s only physical 
 But I love her deep inside 
 I still see you in my dreams 
 With a kitchen knife 
 With it poised above your head 
 Now who you gonna slice? 
 
 When it comes to fighting 
 Trying to play it rough 
 I will take you twenty rounds 
 I`m just too tough, too tough 
 
 Too tough, too tough 
 
 I don`t think you`ll ever know 
 What you`ve bitten off 
 But in the end, you spat me out 
 You could not chew me up 
 I was too tough, too tough 
 Too tough, too tough 
 Too tough, too tough 
 Too tough 
 Too tough, too tough 
 Too tough, too tough

Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
 Waiting for me when I die
 But between the day you`re born and when you die
 You know, they never seem to hear even your cry 
 
 Chorus:
 So as sure as the sun will shine
 I`m gonna get my share now what is mine
 And then the harder they come
 The harder they fall
 One and all
 The harder they come
 The harder they fall
 One and all 
 
 And the oppressors are trying to track me down
 They`re trying to drive me underground
 And they think that they have got the battle won
 I say, forgive them Lord, they know not what they`ve done 
 
 
 And I keep on fighting for the things I want
 Though I know that when you`re dead you can`t
 But I`d rather be a free man in my grave
 Than living as a puppet or a slave

 So I just phoned the airline girl

 Well, I confirmed my reservation. 
 Then I hopped a cab. 
 No idea of my destination 
 And feeling pretty bad. 
 
 With my suitcase in my hand. 
 In my head, my new life. 
 So then I told the airline girl 
 ""Well, get me on flight number 505,

 Alright. 
 
 Well, I sat right there in my seat. 
 Well, feeling like a king. 
 With the whole world right at my feet. 
 ""Of course I`ll have a drink!"" 
 
 Well, suddenly I saw 
 That we never ever would arrive. 
 He put the plane down in the sea. 
 The end of flight number 505.

 Whew, they put the plane down in the sea.

You've been starring in my dreams

I've been waiting in the hall

Been waiting on your call

When the phone rings

It's just some friends of mine that say,

""Hey, what's the matter man?

We're gonna come around at twelve

With some Puerto Rican girls

That are just dyin' to meet you.

We're gonna bring a case of wine

Hey, let's go mess and fool around

You know, like we used to""

Oh baby why you wait so long

Won't you come on! Come on!

I've been walking Central Park

Singing after dark

People think I'm crazy

I've been stumbling on my feet

Shuffling through the street

Asking people, ""What's the matter with you boy?""

Sometimes I want to say to myself

Sometimes I say

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

I guess I'm lying to myself

 Wallow away the evening hours

 The birds hover high

Now you don't talk so loud

About having to be scrounging

For your next meal



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

A complete unknown

Just like a rolling stone?



You went to the finest schools all right, Miss Lonely

But you know you only used to get juiced in it

And nobody taught you how to

Live out on the street

But now you are gonna have

to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise

With the mystery tramp, but now you Realize

That he's not selling any alibis

As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes

And say : ""Do you want to make a deal?""



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

Like a complete unknown

Just like a rolling stone?



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

A complete unknown

Just like a rolling stone?



Princess on the steeple and the pretty people

They're drinkin', thinkin' that they

Got it made

Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts

But you'd better take that diamond ring,

You'd better pawn it babe

You used to be so amused

At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used

Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse

When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose

You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

A complete unknown

Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
 Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
 I`m a poor man`s son, from across the railroad tracks,
 the only shirt I own , is hanging on my back,
 but I`m the envy of every single guy
 since I`m the apple of my girls eye
 when we go out stepping on the town.
 For a while my money`s low,
 and my suit`s out of style, but it`s all right
 if my clothes aren`t new,
 out of sight, because my heart is true,
 she says baby everything is all right,
 uptight, out of sight, baby everything is
 all right, uptight, clean out of sight.

 But who are you to tell her who to love? 
 That`s up to her, yes, and the Lord above 
 You better move on 
 
 Well I know you can buy her fancy clothes 
 But I believe she`s happy with me without those things 
 Still you beg me to set her free 
 But my friend, that will never be 
 You better move on 
 
 Now I don`t blame you for loving her 
 But can`t you understand, man, she`s my girl 
 And I, never never ever gonna let her go 
 ‘Cuz I, yeah, I love her so

 And she looked into her crystal ball

 Looking forward to my big surprise

 As if it came from up above

 Yeah, and the codeine to fix it.

 Who`s gonna help him to kick it

 It`s seen much better days.

As I was driving home along the boulevard late one night
 I saw a guy in the corner, bumming all alone
 As I passed him by, I heard him holler out: ""Hey!""
 I slowed down to see what he said, he said:
 ""Eh! By any chance, are you goin` my way?""
 I said: ""sure baby, hop on in and give me a cigarette""
 Then he reached out in his pocket
 And that was the moment I regret
 Well now boy ""Reach for the sky!""
 Because I don`t understand, sir
 ""Don`t you try no monkey business, I got a stopper in my hand!""
 
 An` then he said: ""You see this rock I got in my hand?
 This is a 38 pistol built on a 45 frame
 It shoots tombstone bullets an` a ball and chain!""
 He said: ""I ain`t tryin` to shake you up, but I just want you to know
 If the cops start to crowding me in
 You`re gonna be the first to go!
 You just drive on just like there ain`t nothin` happenin`""
 That`s what he told me, he wouldn`t even let me look back at nothin`
 
 And he said: ""when you get to that red light
 I want you to jump back your left and then switch back your right""
 He said: ""Now, I want you to park up in that alley
 Ah ah, not that alley, that one over there
 And cool it behind that liquor store
 And keep a sharp lookout at all times
 While I sneak in that back door""
 That`s what he told me
 He said:""keep your foot on the gas
 And always be on guard
 `cos when I come runnin` out the liquor store with all that money
 He wanted me to mash on it real hard
 He said: ""Now don`t you come out of there an` try me a double-crossed
 Because it`s murder when the heats on!""
 
 Well now boy ""Reach for the sky!""
 Yeah but I don`t understand, sir
 ""Don`t you try no monkey business, I got a stopper in my hand!""
 
 Ooeee, while I was sittin` there just tremblin`
 A spotlight hit me dead in the face
 An` a cop pulled up behind me and said:
 ""Move up a bit man, for we want to take your place!""
 An` then this guy come runnin` out of the store with the money in his hand
 And said ""Oh there you are!""
 He made a mistake in the dark and ran and leaped in the police car!
 When they put the handcuffs on him
 I said: ""Child, your crime must have outgrew him!""
 An` then they said: ""Yeh, we gonna put him so far back in jail this time
 
 That they`re gonna have to pump air into him!""

 Spare a thought for his back breaking work 
 Say a prayer for his wife and his children

 Who need leaders but get gamblers instead 
 
 Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter 
 His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows 
 And a parade of the gray suited grafters 
 A choice of cancer or polio 
 
 And when I look in the faceless crowd 
 A swirling mass of grays and black and white

 Making bloodshot eyes at ev`ry woman that you meet.

 And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn.

 With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes.

 I always find a way to get it, baby
 Including you 
 
 I could be there Thanksgiving afternoon
 If I start off now put my foot down the floor, damn too 
 
 I spoke to big sister on the telephone
 She said come on big brother
 Why don`t you come on back home 
 
 I said, lonely hearts
 They`re just made to break
 There ain`t no spare parts
 Aint` no oil to change

We`ve got trouble, that`s for sure 
 We got millions unemployed 
 Some kids can`t write 
 Some kids can`t read 
 Some kids are hungry 
 Some overeat 
 
 Our TV leader boldy speaks 
 The words of Christ he tries to preach 
 We need more power to hold the line 
 The strength of darkness still abides 
 
 Must be hell living in the world 
 Living in the world like you 
 Must be hell living in the world 
 Suffering in the world like you 
 
 Keep in a straight line, stay in tune 
 No need to worry, only fools 
 End up in prison of conscience cells 
 Or in asylums they help to build 
 
 Must be hell living in the world 
 Suffering in the world like you you you you 
 Must be hell living in the world 
 Suffering in the world like you 
 Must be hell 
 Suffering in the world like you 
 
 We`re free to worship, we`re free to speak 
 We`re free to kill, that`s guaranteed 
 We got our problems, that`s for sure 
 Clean up the backyard, don`t lock the door 
 
 Must be hell living in the world

 Must be hell living in the world

In the heat of the day down in Mobile, Alabama
 Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer
 Gotta make some money to buy some brand new shoes
 Tryin` to find somebody to take away these blues
 ""She don`t love me"" hear them singing in the sun
 Payday`s coming and my work is all done 
 
 Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
 All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
 Sitting in a teepee built right on the tracks
 Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
 Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about
 We`ve got an off-schedule train comin? two miles about 
 
 Everybody`s scrambling, running around
 Picking up their money, tearing the teepee down
 Foreman wants to panic, ?bout to go insane
 Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
 Engineer blows the whistle loud and long
 Can`t stop the train, gotta let it roll on

I had a dream last night, I was piloting a plane

And all the passengers were drunk and insane

I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp

Shot up a horde of zombies, but I come out on top



What’s it all about, it just reflects my mood

Sitting in the dirt, feeling kind of hurt



All I hear is doom and gloom

And all is darkness in my room

And through the light your face I see

Baby take a chance, baby, won’t you dance with me



Lost all that treasure in an overseas war

It just goes to show you, don’t get what you paid for

Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor

Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors



Hear a funky noise, that’s the tightening of the screws

I’m feeling kind of hurt, sitting in the dirt



All I hear is doom and gloom

But when those drums go boom, boom, boom

And through the night, your face I see

Baby take a chance, baby, won’t you dance with me

Yeah, baby, won’t you dance with me, oh yeah



Fracking deep for off, but there’s nothing in the sump

There’s kids all picking at the garbage dumb

I’m running out of water, so I better prime the pump

I’m trying to stay sober, but I end up drunk



We’ll be eating dirt, living on the side of the road

There’s some food for thought, kind of makes your head explode

Feeling kind of hurt, yeah



But all I hear is doom and gloom

And all is darkness in my room

And through the night, your face I see

Baby come on, baby, won’t you dance with me, yeah

Yeah, baby, won’t you dance with me



I’m feeling kind of hurt, baby, won’t you dance with me

Oh yeah, come on, dance with me

Well a poor boy took his father`s bread and started down the road 
 Started down the road 
 Took all he had and started down the road 
 Going out in this world, where God only knows 
 And that`ll be the way to get along 
 
 Well poor boy spent all he had, famine come in the land 
 Famine come in the land 
 Spent all he had and famine come in the land 
 Said, ""I believe I`ll go and hire me to some man"" 
 And that`ll be the way I`ll get along 
 
 Well, man said, ""I`ll give you a job for to feed my swine 
 For to feed my swine 
 I`ll give you a job for to feed my swine"" 
 Boy stood there and hung his head and cried 
 `Cause that is no way to get along 
 
 Said, ""I believe I`ll ride, believe I`ll go back home 
 Believe I`ll go back home 
 Believe I`ll ride, believe I`ll go back home 
 Or down the road as far as I can go"" 
 And that`ll be the way to get along 
 
 Well, father said, ""See my son coming home to me 
 Coming home to me"" 
 Father ran and fell down on his knees 
 Said, ""Sing and praise, Lord have mercy on me"" 
 Mercy 
 
 Oh poor boy stood there, hung his head and cried 
 Hung his head and cried 
 Poor boy stood and hung his head and cried 
 Said, ""Father will you look on me as a child?"" 
 Yeah 
 
 Well father said, ""Eldest son, kill the fatted calf, 
 Call the family round 
 Kill that calf and call the family round 
 My son was lost but now he is found 
 `Cause that`s the way for us to get along""

 Crank it up to straight double time

 You might as well get juiced

 Buss it off with alcohol 
 Give me a little taste of those fumes 
 I need a little boost

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

With flowers and my love

both never to come back

I see people turn their heads and quickly look away

Like a new born baby it just happens ev`ry day



I look inside myself and see my heart is black

I see my red door and it has been painted black

Maybe then I`ll fade away and not have to face the facts

It`s not easy facin` up

when your whole world is black



No more will my green sea

go turn a deeper blue

I could not foresee this thing happening to you



If I look hard enough into the settin` sun

My love will laugh with me before the mornin` comes



I see a red door and I want it painted black

No colors anymore I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes

I have to turn my head

until my darkness goes



Hmm, hmm, hmm,...



I wanna see it painted, painted black

Black as night, black as coal

I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky

I wanna see it painted, painted,

painted, painted black

Yesterday don't matter if it's gone

While the sun is bright

Or in the darkest night

No one knows

She comes and goes



Goodbye, ruby tuesday

Who could hang a name on you?

When you change with every new day

Still I'm gonna miss you...



Don't question why she needs to be so free

She'll tell you it's the only way to be

She just can't be chained

To a life where nothing's gained

And nothing's lost

At such a cost



There's no time to lose, I heard her say

Catch your dreams before they slip away

Dying all the time

Lose your dreams

And you will lose your mind

Ain't life unkind?

 I can make a ship sail on dry land
 But my life is incomplete and I`m so blue
 `Cause I can`t get next to you
 Next to you, I just can`t get next to you 
 
 I can fly like a bird in the sky
 Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy
 I can turn a river into a raging fire
 I could live forever if I so desired
 Unimportant are all these things I can do
 `Cause I can`t get next to you
 No matter what I do 
 
 I can turn back the hands of time
 You`d better believe I can
 I can make the seasons change
 Just by a wave of my hand
 I can change anything from old to new
 The thing I want to do the most I`m unable to do
 Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
 `Cause girl, you`re the key to my happiness
 And I, wo, I can`t get next to you

Yes, star crossed in pleasure the stream flows on by 
 Yes, as we`re sated in leisure, we watch it fly 
 
 And time waits for no one, and it won`t wait for me

 Time can tear down a building or destroy a woman`s face 
 Hours are like diamonds, don`t let them waste 
 
 Time waits for no one, no favours has he 
 Time waits for no one, and he won`t wait for me 
 
 Men, they build towers to their passing yes, to their fame everlasting 
 Here he comes chopping and reaping, hear him laugh at their cheating 
 
 And time waits for no man, and it won`t wait for me

 Drink in your summer, gather your corn 
 The dreams of the night time will vanish by dawn 
 
 And time waits for no one, and it won`t wait for me

 No no no, not for me....

But there was a note

And my heart it jumped into my mouth

It read, ""Darlin', I'm sorry to hurt you.

But I have no courage to speak to your face.

But I'm down in Virginia with your cousin Lou

There be no wedding today.""

 Oh baby, you knoooow what I like! 
 
 Chantilly Lace had a pretty face and a ponytail hangin` down
 A wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk
 Make the world go `round
 Ain`t nothing in the world like a big eyed girl
 To make me act so funny, make me spend my money
 Make me feel real loose like a long necked goose
 Like a--oh baby, that`s a-what I like!

You`re deaf to it, blind to it 
 It`s like a thunderclap 
 Feel the prickles running 
 Up and down your back 
 Why so divine, the pain of love 
 
 You have to work at it, stay with it 
 Pay for it, bust your ass 
 Lie for it, cheat for it 
 Forget about your past 
 Why so divine, the pain of love 
 
 You dream of it passionate 
 You get a rise from it 
 Feel the hot cum 
 Dripping on your thighs from it 
 Why why so divine, the pain of love 
 
 Sometimes you crave for it, cry for it 
 Women will die for it 
 Looking back, cut the crap 
 Was it really worth the rap? 
 It`s hard to survive the pain of love 
 
 Ooh I need a time out 
 Time to make my mind up 
 Substitute a line out 
 I`ll be back next season with a bang 
 
 No release from the jail 
 No parole, no bail 
 Hard labor, fifty lashes 
 Hard labor, money splashes 
 It`s hard to survive the pain of love 
 
 The old maid is roughing up 
 Applying final touches 
 Even though she`s late for the dance 
 I tell you tonight she`s really gonna have a ball 
 She`s gonna really tie me up 
 She`s gonna really tie me up 
 She`s gonna really tie me up 
 She`s gonna really tie me up 
 She`s gonna really tie me up 
 
 Why so divine the pain of love 
 
 Don`t hurt me, don`t hurt me 
 Don`t hurt me, don`t hurt me 
 
 Why so divine the pain of love 
 That`s what they call it: the pain of love 
 Tie me up, tie me up, tie me up, tie me up 
 
 Why do divine, the pain of love 
 
 Don`t hurt me, don`t hurt me, don`t hurt me 
 Don`t hurt me, don`t hurt me, don`t hurt me 
 Don`t hurt me, don`t hurt me, don`t hurt me.....

I bought a brand new airmobile 
 It was custom made 
 It was a Flight DeVille 
 With an outboard motor 
 And some hideaway wings 
 Push in on the button and you can hear her sing 
 Now you can`t catch me 
 No, baby, you can`t catch me 
 `Cause if you get too close 
 You know I`m gone like a cool breeze 
 
 New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours 
 I was rolling slowly `cause of drizzlin` showers 
 Up come a flattop he was movin` up with me 
 Then come sailin` goodbye 
 In a little old suped up mini 
 I put my foot in my tank and I begin to roll 
 Moanin` sirens, was the state patrol 
 So I get out my wings and then I blew my horn 
 Bye-bye New Jersey I become airborne 
 
 Now you can`t catch me 
 No, baby you can`t catch me 
 `Cause if you get too close 
 You know I`m gone like a cool breeze 
 
 Flyin` with my baby last Saturday night 
 Wasn`t no gray cloud floatin` in sight 
 Big full moon shinin` up above 
 Cuddle up honey be my love 
 Sweetest little thing that I ever seen 
 I`m gonna name you Mabelline 
 Flyin` with all the things set on flight control 
 Radio tuned to rock `n` roll 
 Two, three hours passin` by 
 Altitude dropped to 505 
 Fuel consumption way too fast 
 Let`s get on home before we run out of gas 
 
 Now you can`t catch me 
 No baby, you can`t catch me 
 `Cause if you get too close 
 You know I`m gone like a cool breeze

Sittin` in my bedroom late last night 
 Got into bed and turned out the light 
 Decided to call my baby on the telephone 
 All I got was an engaged tone 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 
 Talkin` so long she upset my mind 
 Why is she talkin` such a long time? 
 Maybe she`s sleeping, maybe she`s ill 
 Phone`s disconnected, unpaid bill 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 
 Don`t wanna see her, afraid of what I`d find 
 Tired of letting her upset me all the time 
 Back into bed started reading my books 
 Take my phone right off of the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 
 It`s off the hook

My story is much too sad to be told,
 But practically everything leaves me totally cold.
 The only exception I know is the case,
 When I`m out on a quiet spree fightly vainly the old ennui,
 And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face! 
 
 I get no kick from champagne, mere alcohol doesn`t thrill me
 at all,
 So tell me why should it be true, that I get a kick out of you?
 Some get a kick from cocaine, I`m sure that if I took even
 one sniff
 That would bore me terrifically, too, yet I get a kick out of
 you.
 I get a kick every time I see you`re standing there before me.
 I get a kick though it`s clear to me, you obviously don`t
 adore me.
 I get no kick in a plane, flying too high with some gal in the
 sky
 Is my idea of nothing to do, yet I get a kick out of you!

Why does the sky turn grey ev`ry night
 Sun rise again in time
 Why do you think of the first girl you had
 Some things just stick in your mind 
 
 Why does the rain fall down on the earth
 Why do the clouds keep cryin`
 Why do you sleep curled up like a child
 Some things just stick in your mind 
 
 Why when the children grow up and leave
 Still remember their nursery rhymes
 Why must there be so much hate in their lives
 Some things just stick in their minds

That`s all right, that`s all right, that`s all right. 
 Sometimes you feel like trouble, sometimes you feel down. 
 Let this music relax you mind, let this music relax you mind. 
 Stand up and be counted, can I get a witness. 
 Sometimes you need somebody, if you have somebody to love. 
 Sometimes you ain`t got nobody and you want somebody to love. 
 Then you don`t want to walk and talk about Jesus, 
 You just want to see his face. 
 You don`t want to walk and talk about Jesus, 
 You just want to see his face.

What a drag it is getting old

Kids are different today

I hear every mother say

Mother needs something today to calm her down

And though she's not really ill

There's a little yellow pill

She goes running for the shelter

Of a mother's little helper

And it helps her on her way

Gets her through her busy day



Things are different today

I hear every mother say

Cooking fresh food for a husband is just a drag

So she buys an instant cake

And she burns her frozen steak

And goes running for the shelter

Of a mother's little helper

And two help her on her way

Get her through her busy day



Doctor, please, some more of these

Outside the door, she took four more

What a drag it is getting old



Men just aren't the same today

I hear every mother say

They just don't appreciate that you get tired

They're so hard to satisfy

You can tranquillize your mind

So go running for the shelter

Of a mother's little helper

And four help you through the night

Help to minimize your plight



Doctor, please, some more of these

Outside the door, she took four more

What a drag it is getting old



Lifes just much too hard today

I hear every mother say

The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore

And if you take more of those

You will get an overdose

No more running for the shelter

Of a mothers little helper

They just helped you on your way

 I sung that song, I wrote that fucking book 
 
 Do yourself a favor now 
 Don`t drive me `round the block 
 Let`s split another bottle, now 
 Let`s take a hit, loosen up 
 
 Don`t get too tight on me 
 `Cause I`m, I`m bound so tight I can`t breathe 
 
 We`ll watch the sun go down 
 Upon the swollen sea 
 Aahhhhhh 
 If you try to chain me up 
 I`ll vanish like a broken dream 
 
 Don`t get so tight 
 Don`t get so tight 
 Too tight

When the wind blows and the rain feels cold 
 With a head full of snow

 In the window there`s a face you know 
 Don`t the night pass slow 
 Don`t the nights pass slow 
 
 The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind 
 Just another mad mad day on the road 
 I am just living to be lying by your side 
 But I`m just about a moonlight mile on down the road 
 
 Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes 
 Gonna warm my bones 
 Gonna warm my bones 
 I got silence on my radio 
 Let the air waves flow 
 Let the air waves flow 
 
 Oh I`m sleeping under strange strange skies 
 Just another mad mad day on the road 
 My dreams is fading down the railway line 
 I`m just about a moonlight mile down the road 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
 
 I`m hiding sister and I`m dreaming 
 I`m riding down your moonlight mile

 Soon we`ll be married and raise a family 
 Two boys for you, what about two girls for me

 Whatever it is I want baby I seek and I shall find 
 
 I`ll tell ya

 Running away with me 
 
 Every night I hope and pray 
 ""Dear lord, hear my plea 
 Don`t ever let another take her love from me 
 Or I will surely die"" 
 
 Her love is ecstasy 
 When her arms enfold me 
 I hear her tender rhapsody 
 But in reality, she doesn`t even know... me

John Wesley Harding
 Was a friend to the poor,
 He trav`led with a gun in ev`ry hand.
 All along this countryside,
 He opened a many a door,
 But he was never known
 To hurt a honest man. 
 
 `Twas down in Chaynee County,
 A time they talk about,
 With his lady by his side
 He took a stand.
 And soon the situation there
 Was all but straightened out,
 For he was always known
 To lend a helping hand. 
 
 All across the telegraph
 His name it did resound,
 But no charge held against him
 Could they prove.
 And there was no man around
 Who could track or chain him down,
 He was never known
 To make a foolish move.

I'm just trying to make some sense

The tales they tell of men

I'm just waiting on a friend



A smile relieves a heart that grieves

Remember what I said

I'm not waiting on a lady

I'm just waiting on a friend

I'm just waiting on a friend



Don't need a whore

I don't need no booze

Don't need a virgin priest

But I need someone I can cry to

I need someone to protect

Making love and breaking hearts

It is a game for youth

But I'm not waiting on a lady

Exile on Mainstreet, it`s a strange street to walk down
 Exile on Mainstreet, it`s a strange street to walk down 
 
 [All down the Line]
 Mmm heard the diesel drumming all down the line
 Mmm heard the wires a-humming all down the line
 Oh, yeah heard the women sighing all down the line
 Oh, yeah heard the children crying all down the line 
 
 All down the line we`ll be watching out for trouble, yeah 
 
 [Tumbling Dice]
 Women think I`m tasty
 But they`re always trying to waste me
 And make me burn the candle right down
 But baby, baby I don`t need no jewels in my frown
 `Cause all you women is low down gamblers
 Cheating like I don`t know how
 But baby there`s a fever in the funk house now
 This low down bitchings got my poor feet a-itching
 Do you know the deuce is still wild
 Baby can`t stay, you got to roll me
 And call me the tumbling dice 
 
 [Intro]
 Exile on Mainstreet, it`s a strange street to walk down
 Now let it loose, now come on, let it all hang down
 Eh round up those people, move them out of town
 Gimmie little drink from your loving cup
 Now shake your hip mama, keep me all shook up
 Feeling so doggone happy like a natural child
 Oh help me do the boogie all down the line
 Come on Virginia, let`s shoot some dice
 My sweet black angel, shine a light 
 
 [Shine A Light]
 Saw you stretched out in room ten o nine
 With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
 Couldn`t see to get a line on you, my sweet honey love
 Berber, jewelry jangling down the street
 making bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet
 Come out baby to get a high on you, my sweet honey love 
 
 May the good Lord shine a light on you
 Make every song you sing your favorite tune
 May the good Lord shine a light on you
 Warm like the evening sun.
 Well you`re drunk in the alley baby... 
 
 [Happy]
 Never kept a dollar past sunset
 It always burned a hole in my pants
 Never made a school mama happy,
 never blew a second chance 
 
 I need a love to keep me happy,
 I need a love to keep me happy
 Baby baby keep me happy,
 Baby keep me happy 
 
 Always took candy from strangers,
 Didn`t want to get me no trade
 Never want to be like papa,
 Working for the boss every night and day 
 
 I need a love to keep me happy,
 I need a love to keep me happy
 Baby baby keep me happy,
 Baby baby keep me happy 
 
 [Outro]
 Exile on Mainstreet, it`s a strange street to walk down
 Exile on Mainstreet, it`s a low down dirty ground.

I want to dance, I want to sing 
 I want to bust up everything 
 To make some love 
 I want to dance, I want to sing 
 I want to bust up everything 
 And make some love 
 
 I can feel it in the air 
 Feel it up above 
 Feel the tension everywhere 
 There is too much blood 
 Too much blood, well alright 
 
 Everything you see 
 On the movie screen is tame 
 Everything`s gonna be arranged 
 
 A friend of mine was this Japanese. He had a girlfriend in 
 Paris. He tried to date her in six months and eventually she 
 said yes. You know he took her to his apartment, cut off her 
 head. Put the rest of her body in the refrigerator, ate her 
 piece by piece. Put her in the refrigerator, put her in the 
 freezer. And when he ate her and took her bones to the Bois de 
 Boulogne, by chance a taxi driver noticed him burying the 
 bones. You don`t believe me? Truth is stranger than fiction. 
 We drive through there every day. 
 
 I want to dance, I want to sing 
 I want to bust up everything 
 Be number one, yeah 
 I want to dance, I want to sing 
 I want to bust up everything 
 And have some fun 
 
 I can feel it everywhere 
 Feel it up above 
 Feel the tension in the air 
 There is too much blood, too much blood 
 Too much, yeah too much blood, alright 
 
 Did you ever see `Texas Chain Saw Massacre`? Horrible, wasn`t 
 it? You know people ask me: it is really true where you live 
 in Texas, it is really true what they do around there, people? 
 I say, ""yeah everytime I drive through the crossroads I get 
 scared there`s a bloke running around with a fucking chain 
 saw. Oh oh no, gonna, oh no. Don`t saw off me leg, don`t saw 
 off me arm."" When I get to the movies, you know I`d like to 
 see something more romantic, you know. Like `An Officer and a 
 Gentleman` or something. Something you can take the wife to, 
 you know what I mean? 
 
 Yeah! 
 
 I want to dance, I want to sing 
 I want to bust up everything 
 And have some fun 
 I want to dance, I want to sing 
 I want to bust up everything 
 And make some love 
 
 I can feel it everywhere 
 Feel it up above 
 Feel the tension in the air 
 There is too much blood, too much blood 
 Oh yeah 
 
 Pretty ladies, don`t be scared 
 Pretty ladies, don`t be scared 
 Pretty ladies, don`t be scared 
 Pretty ladies, don`t be scared 
 
 Pretty ladies, don`t despair 
 There`s still so much love 
 Pretty ladies, don`t despair 
 Too much, too much, yeah 
 Too much blood, too much blood 
 Too much too much blood, too much blood 
 Too much blood, too much blood............

 Even if I`m going away
 
 And she take you down by the waist

 She never said that with her eyes
 She said ""Don`t you understand""
 ""I`m tempted but yeah if I find the road, I`m gonna ride""
 
 Ooooh, oooh, ooh, aah (repeat)
 
 The way she held me tight
 I knew all right
 In just a minute I`d be galloping away down the misty road
 
 And jump
 
 Oooh.....
 
 And jump, and jump, and . . . 
 
 The way she held me tight
 Its a brilliant moonlight
 I`d always thought that everybody was kicking us down the moonlight hill
 
 We had heroin and booze
 Those assholes that run us in
 Said its a locked up case

And your father'd be there with her

Now she gets her kicks in Stepney

Not in Knightsbridge anymore

Men are armed shout who goes there 
 We have journeyed far from here 
 Armed with bibles make us swear 
 
 Candy and Taffy, hope we both are well 
 Please come see me in the citadel 
 
 Flags are flying, dollar bills 
 Round the heights of concrete hills 
 You can see the pinnacles 
 
 Candy and taffy, hope we both are well 
 Please come see me in the citadel 
 
 In the streets are many walls 
 Hear the peasants come and crawl 
 You can hear their lovers call

 In their shiny metal cars

No good, can`t speak, wound up, no sleep. 
 Sky diver insider her, skip rope, stunt flyer. 
 Wounded lover, got no time on hand. 
 One last cycle, thrill freak Uncle Sam. 
 Pause for bus`ness, hope you`ll understand. 
 Judge and jury walk out hand in hand. 
 Dietrich movies, close up boogies, 
 Kissing cunt in Cannes. 
 
 Grotesque music, million dollar sad.

 Watch that hat in black.

We sell them missiles, We sell them tanks

We give them credit, You can call up the bank

It's just a business, You can pay us in crude

You'll love these toys, just go play out your feuds

We got no pride, don't know whose boots to lick

We act so greedy, makes me sick sick sick

So get up, stand up, out of my way

I want to talk to the boss right away

Get up, stand up, who's going to pay

I want to talk to the man right away

We walk the highwire

Sending men to the front line

And hoping they don't catch the hell-fire

Of hot guns and cold, cold lies

We walk the highwire

Send the men to the front lines

And tell them to hotbed the sunshine

With hot guns and cold, cold lies

Our lives are threatened, our jobs at risk

Sometimes dictators need a slap on the wrist

Another Munich we just can't afford

We're going to send in the 82nd Airborne

We walk the highwire

Putting the world out on a dead lie

And hoping they don't taste the shell-fire

Of hot guns and cold, cold lies

Putting the world out on a dead lie

Catching the fight on the primetime

With hot guns and cold, cold lies

Get up! Stand up!

Hey!

Sending men to the front line

The awful truth is really sad

I must admit I was awful bad



While lovers laugh and music plays

I stumble by and I hide my pain

The lamps are lit the moon is gone

I think I've crossed the Rubicon



And I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Walked the streets of love

And they're full of tears

And I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Walked the streets of love

And they are full of fears



While music pumps from passing cars

A couple watched me from a bar

A band just played the wedding march

and the cornerstore mends broken hearts

A woman asked me for a dance

Oh, It's free of charge just one more chance



Oh I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Walked the streets of love

And they are full of tears

And I, I, I, I, I, I, I

Charlie's good tonight, isn't he?)

I met a gin soaked barroom queen in Memphis

She tried to take me upstairs for a ride (yeah)

She had to heave me right across her shoulder

Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind (no)

It's the Honky Tonk Women (yeah)

Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris

As naked as the day that I will die

The sailors they're so charming there in Paris

But they just don't seem to sail you off my mind (yeah)

It's the Honky Tonk women

Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

(yeah)

It's the Honky Tonk women, yeah

And give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues (my my)

So now that she is gone 
 You won`t be sad for long 
 For maybe just an hour or just a moment 
 Of the day 
 
 Then blue turns to grey 
 And try as you may 
 You just don`t feel good 
 You don`t feel alright 
 And you know that you must find her, find her, find her 
 
 You think you`ll have a ball 
 And you won`t care at all 
 You`ll find another girl or maybe more 
 To pass the time away

 I walked 47 miles on barb wire,
 Use a cobra-snake for a necktie.
 Got a brand new house on the roadside,
 Made from rattlesnake hide.
 I got a brand new chimney on top,
 Made from a human skulls.

Really is too horrifying

So I'm sittin on a fence

And they mortgaged up their lives

 I can only get it from you 
 
 Give me the truth 
 Just between me and you 
 
 Give me the low down 
 If you can 
 Don`t want a show down 
 I just want to know where I stand 
 
 Give me the low down 
 As quick as you can 
 I don`t want to hear about it 
 I want it straight from you 
 
 Give me the truth

Sweethearts together 
 We`ve only just begun 
 Sweethearts together 
 We`ll take life as it comes 
 Sweathearts forever 
 Two hearts together as one 
 
 Everybody needs someone 
 To tell their troubles to 
 To share the pain and laughter 
 In a world beset with fools 
 To help you with your ups and downs 
 Someone to heal your wounds 
 So we`re 
 
 Sweethearts together 
 When two hearts beat as one 
 Sweethearts together 
 We`ve only just begun 
 Sweethearts forever 
 Two hearts together as one 
 As one 
 
 Everyone so cynical 
 And says that love won`t last 
 Think about your future 
 Stop living in the past 
 Time`s not standing still 
 So stop looking through those tinted glasses 
 
 Sweathearts together 
 We`ve only just begun 
 Sweathearts together 
 So glad I`ve found someone 
 Sweethearts forever 
 Two hearts together as one 
 As one 
 
 But love is never easy 
 It`s never silky smooth 
 There`s always something tempting 
 In the wilderness of youth 
 But I will stay right by your side 
 The truth will out, you`ll realize 
 We`re 
 
 Sweathearts together we`ve only just begun 
 Sweathearts together 
 So glad I found someone 
 Sweethearts forever 
 Two hearts together as one

Down in the graveyard where we have our tryst 
 The air smells sweet, the air smells sick 
 He never smiles, his mouth merely twists 
 The breath in my lungs feels clinging and thick 
 But I know his name, he`s called Mr. D. 
 And one of these days he`s gonna set you free 
 Human skulls is hangin` right `round his neck 
 The palms of my hands is clammy and wet 
 
 Lord, I was dancin`, dancin`, dancin` so free 
 Dancin`, dancin`, dancin` so free 
 Dancin`, Lord, keep your hand off me 
 Dancin` with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D. 
 
 Will it be poison put in my glass 
 Will it be slow or will it be fast? 
 The bite of a snake, the sting of a spider 
 A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night 
 Hiding in a corner in New York City 
 Lookin` down a fourty-four in West Virginia 
 
 I was dancin`, dancin`, dancin` so free 
 Dancin`, dancin`, dancin` so free 
 Dancin`, Lord, keep your hand off me 
 Dancin` with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D. 
 
 One night I was dancin` with a lady in black 
 Wearin` black silk gloves and a black silk hat 
 She looked at me longin` with black velvet eyes 
 She gazed at me strange all cunning and wise 
 Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones 
 The eyes in her skull was burning like coals 
 Lord, have mercy, fire and brimstone 
 I was dancin` with Mrs. D. 
 
 Lord, I was dancin`, dancin`, dancin` so free 
 I was dancin`, dancin`, dancin` so free 
 Dancin`, dancin`, dancin` so free 
 
 Dancin`, dancin`

 In the silk sheet of time 
 I will find peace of mind

 At three o`clock in the morning, babe, well

 And the girls in the doorway 
 And the boys in the game

 And the police on the corner

 As they point me 
 To my final destination
