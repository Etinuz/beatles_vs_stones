" Like A Rolling Stone
Once upon a time you dressed so fine

You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?

People'd call, say ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""

You thought they were just kiddin' you

You used to laugh about

Everybody that was hangin' out

And now you don't walk so proud

Now you don't talk so loud

About having to be scrounging

For your next meal



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

A complete unknown

Just like a rolling stone?



You went to the finest schools all right, Miss Lonely

But you know you only used to get juiced in it

And nobody taught you how to

Live out on the street

But now you are gonna have

to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise

With the mystery tramp, but now you Realize

That he's not selling any alibis

As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes

And say : ""Do you want to make a deal?""



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

Like a complete unknown

Just like a rolling stone?



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

A complete unknown

Just like a rolling stone?



Princess on the steeple and the pretty people

They're drinkin', thinkin' that they

Got it made

Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts

But you'd better take that diamond ring,

You'd better pawn it babe

You used to be so amused

At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used

Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse

When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose

You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal



How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

A complete unknown

Just like a rolling stone?  ",stones,641
" Uptight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
 Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
 I`m a poor man`s son, from across the railroad tracks,
 the only shirt I own , is hanging on my back,
 but I`m the envy of every single guy
 since I`m the apple of my girls eye
 when we go out stepping on the town.
 For a while my money`s low,
 and my suit`s out of style, but it`s all right
 if my clothes aren`t new,
 out of sight, because my heart is true,
 she says baby everything is all right,
 uptight, out of sight, baby everything is
 all right, uptight, clean out of sight.

You ask me to give up the hand of the girl I love 
 You tell me, I`m not the man she`s worthy of 
 But who are you to tell her who to love?

 You better move on

 But I believe she`s happy with me without those things 
 Still you beg me to set her free 
 But my friend, that will never be 
 You better move on

 But can`t you understand, man, she`s my girl 
 And I, never never ever gonna let her go 
 ‘Cuz I, yeah, I love her so

 You ask me to give up the only love I`ve ever had 
 Maybe I would, oh, but I love her so 
 I`m never gonna let her go 
 You better move on

 All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
 Sitting in a teepee built right on the tracks
 Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
 Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about
 We`ve got an off-schedule train comin? two miles about 
 
 Everybody`s scrambling, running around
 Picking up their money, tearing the teepee down
 Foreman wants to panic, ?bout to go insane
 Trying to get the workers out the way of the train

Please allow me to introduce myself

I'm a man of wealth and taste

I've been around for a long, long year

Stole many a man's soul and faith

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ

Had his moment of doubt and pain

Made damn sure that Pilate

Washed his hands and sealed his fate



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guess my name

But what's puzzling you

Is the nature of my game



I stuck around St. Petersburg

When I saw it was a time for a change

Killed the czar and his ministers

Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank

Held a general's rank

When the blitzkrieg raged

And the bodies stank



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guess my name, oh yeah

Ah, what's puzzling you

Is the nature of my game, oh yeah



I watched with glee

While your kings and queens

Fought for ten decades

For the gods they made

I shouted out,

""Who killed the Kennedys?""

When after all

It was you and me

Let me please introduce myself

I'm a man of wealth and taste

And I laid traps for troubadours

Who get killed before they reached Bombay



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah

But what's puzzling you

Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah

But what's confusing you

Is just the nature of my game



Just as every cop is a criminal

And all the sinners saints

As heads is tails

Just call me Lucifer

'Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me

Have some courtesy

Have some sympathy, and some taste

Use all your well - learned politesse

Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah



Pleased to meet you

Hope you guessed my name, um yeah

But what's puzzling you



Is the nature of my game, um mean it, get down

Oh yeah, get on down

 TV is just a blank 
 Looks like another dead end Sunday

 Monday never feels so bright 
 Ooh the sheets feel cold and lonely 
 
 Who wants to brave the pouring rain 
 For a glass of French champagne? 
 Well grab a cab, grab a cap and baby, come right by 
 
 And she was hot - as she kissed my mouth 
 She was hot - as I wiped her brow 
 She was hot - she pinned me to the ground 
 She was quick - she knew her way around 
 She was hot - as she tore my clothes 
 She was hot - she had no place to go 
 She was hot - on a cold and rainy night 
 
 Detroit was smoky grey 
 Nothing like the good old days 
 Well I got a fever that I`m fighting 
 
 I don`t need your company 
 Leave me in my misery 
 I can take the rebound just like lightning 
 
 And she was hot - in a 50`s dress 
 She was hot - her lips were flashing red 
 I was lost - in her burning flesh 
 I was hot - I was dripping sweat 
 She was hot - in the Detroit snow 
 She was hot - she had no place to go 
 She was hot - on a cold and rainy night 
 
 And she was hot - and I had the blues 
 She was hot - honey, where were you? 
 If you were in my shoes 
 You would be excused 
 She was hot - you can never wait 
 She was hot - never hesitate 
 She was hot - on a cold and rainy night 
 
 I think I`m going off the rails 
 Riding down the pleasure trails 
 I was taking passion where you find it 
 
 Honey when you were young and fresh 
 And you need the touch of your flesh 
 Go take the treasure where you find it 
 
 And she was hot - in the melted snow 
 She was hot - in the molten glow 
 She was hot - she got it in the blood 
 She was hot - like the dam that bursts 
 She was black - she was strong and true 
 She was black - and her eyes were blue 
 She was lost - and she took a chance 
 At just a brief romance 
 
 Down the avenue into the lost bayou 
 Into the tall bamboo, back to the human zoo 
 I wish you all the best, I hope we meet again 
 On a cold Chicago night

 She was hot hot hot

Didn`t I see you down in San Antone on a hot and dusty night? 
 We were eating eggs in Sammy`s when the black man there drew his knife. 
 Aw, you drowned that Jew in Rampton as he washed his sleeveless shirt, 
 You know, that Spanish-speaking gentlemen, the one we all called ""Kurt."" 
 
 Come now, gentleman, I know there`s some mistake. 
 How forgetful I`m becoming, now you fixed your bus`ness straight. 
 
 I remember you in Hemlock Road in nineteen fifty-six. 
 You`re a faggy little leather boy with a smaller piece of stick. 
 You`re a lashing, smashing hunk of man; 
 Your sweat shines sweet and strong. 
 Your organs working perfectly, but there`s a part that`s not screwed on. 
 
 Weren`t you at the Coke convention back on nineteen sixty-five 
 You`re the misbred, grey executive I`ve seen heavily advertised. 
 You`re the great, gray man whose daughter licks policemen`s buttons clean. 
 You`re the man who squats behind the man who works the soft machine. 
 
 Come now, gentleman, your love is all I crave. 
 You`ll still be in the circus when I`m laughing, laughing on my grave. 
 
 When the old men do the fighting and the young men all look on. 
 And the young girls eat their mothers meat from tubes of plasticon. 
 Be wary of these my gentle friends of all the skins you breed. 
 They have a tasty habit - they eat the hands that bleed. 
 
 So remember who you say you are and keep your noses clean. 
 Boys will be boys and play with toys so be strong with your beast. 
 Oh Rosie dear, doncha think it`s queer, so stop me if you please. 
 The baby is dead, my lady said, ""You gentlemen, why you all work for me?""

 Then I hopped a cab. 
 No idea of my destination 
 And feeling pretty bad. 
 
 With my suitcase in my hand. 
 In my head, my new life.

" Far Away Eyes
I was driving home early Sunday morning

through Bakersfield

Listening to gospel music

on the colored radio station

And the preacher said, ""You know you always have the

Lord by your side""



And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran

Twenty red lights in his honor

Thank you Jesus, thank you lord



I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late

And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off

She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find

Much to my surprise, there she was sittin in the corner

A little bleary, worse for wear and tear

Was a girl with far away eyes



So if you're down on your luck

And you can't harmonize

Find a girl with far away eyes

And if you're downright disgusted

And life ain't worth a dime

Get a girl with far away eyes



Well the preacher kept right on saying

that all I had to do was send

Ten dollars to the church of the

sacred bleeding heart of Jesus

Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California

And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio

And all my dreams would come true

So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl

Well, you know what kind of eyes she got



So if you're down on your luck

I know you all sympathize

Find a girl with far away eyes

And if you're downright disgusted

And life ain't worth a dime

Get a girl with far away eyes  ",stones,641

Stuck right in my brain 



You're just a memory of a love 

That used to be 

You're just a memory of a love 

That used to mean so much to me 



She got a mind of her own 

And she use it well 

Well she's one of a kind 

She`s got a mind 

She got a mind of her own 

And she use it mighty fine 



She drove a pick-up truck 

Painted green and blue 

The tires were wearing thin 

She turned a mile or two 

When I asked her where she headed for 

""Back up to Boston, I'm singing in a bar"" 

I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge 

My nerves are shot already 

The road ain't all that smooth 

Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone 

I keep on a feeling that's gnawing in my bones 



You're just a memory of a love 

That used to mean so much to me 

You're just a memory girl 

You're just a sweet memory 

And it used to mean so much to me 

Sha la la la la 



She got a mind of her own 

And she use it well 

Mighty fine, she's one of a kind 



On the seventh day my eyes were all a glaze 

We've been ten thousand miles 

Been in fifteen states 

Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind 

I hit the bottle and hit the sack and cried 

What's all this laughter on the 22nd floor 

It's just some friends of mine 

And they're busting down the door 

Been a lonely night at the Memory Motel  ",stones,641

 Use a cobra-snake for a necktie.
 Got a brand new house on the roadside,
 Made from rattlesnake hide.
 I got a brand new chimney on top,
 Made from a human skulls.
 Now come on baby, let`s take a little walk
 And tell me, who do you love?

 Down the alley an ice wagon flew.

 Come out baby to get a high on you, my sweet honey love

 Make every song you sing your favorite tune
 May the good Lord shine a light on you
 Warm like the evening sun.
 Well you`re drunk in the alley baby...

 head. Put the rest of her body in the refrigerator, ate her 
 piece by piece. Put her in the refrigerator, put her in the 
 freezer. And when he ate her and took her bones to the Bois de 
 Boulogne, by chance a taxi driver noticed him burying the 
 bones. You don`t believe me? Truth is stranger than fiction.

 The air smells sweet, the air smells sick 
 He never smiles, his mouth merely twists 
 The breath in my lungs feels clinging and thick 
 But I know his name, he`s called Mr. D. 
 And one of these days he`s gonna set you free 
 Human skulls is hangin` right `round his neck 
 The palms of my hands is clammy and wet

 Dancin`, dancin`, dancin` so free 
 Dancin`, Lord, keep your hand off me 
 Dancin` with Mr. D., with Mr. D., with Mr. D. 
 
 Will it be poison put in my glass 
 Will it be slow or will it be fast? 
 The bite of a snake, the sting of a spider 
 A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night 
 Hiding in a corner in New York City 
 Lookin` down a fourty-four in West Virginia

 Wearin` black silk gloves and a black silk hat 
 She looked at me longin` with black velvet eyes 
 She gazed at me strange all cunning and wise 
 Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones 
 The eyes in her skull was burning like coals

" You Can't Catch Me
I bought a brand new airmobile 
 It was custom made 
 It was a Flight DeVille 
 With an outboard motor 
 And some hideaway wings 
 Push in on the button and you can hear her sing 
 Now you can`t catch me 
 No, baby, you can`t catch me 
 `Cause if you get too close 
 You know I`m gone like a cool breeze 
 
 New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours 
 I was rolling slowly `cause of drizzlin` showers 
 Up come a flattop he was movin` up with me 
 Then come sailin` goodbye 
 In a little old suped up mini 
 I put my foot in my tank and I begin to roll 
 Moanin` sirens, was the state patrol 
 So I get out my wings and then I blew my horn 
 Bye-bye New Jersey I become airborne 
 
 Now you can`t catch me 
 No, baby you can`t catch me 
 `Cause if you get too close 
 You know I`m gone like a cool breeze 
 
 Flyin` with my baby last Saturday night 
 Wasn`t no gray cloud floatin` in sight 
 Big full moon shinin` up above 
 Cuddle up honey be my love 
 Sweetest little thing that I ever seen 
 I`m gonna name you Mabelline 
 Flyin` with all the things set on flight control 
 Radio tuned to rock `n` roll 
 Two, three hours passin` by 
 Altitude dropped to 505 
 Fuel consumption way too fast 
 Let`s get on home before we run out of gas 
 
 Now you can`t catch me 
 No baby, you can`t catch me 
 `Cause if you get too close 
 You know I`m gone like a cool breeze

" Off The Hook
Sittin` in my bedroom late last night 
 Got into bed and turned out the light 
 Decided to call my baby on the telephone 
 All I got was an engaged tone 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 
 Talkin` so long she upset my mind 
 Why is she talkin` such a long time? 
 Maybe she`s sleeping, maybe she`s ill 
 Phone`s disconnected, unpaid bill 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 
 Don`t wanna see her, afraid of what I`d find 
 Tired of letting her upset me all the time 
 Back into bed started reading my books 
 Take my phone right off of the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook 
 It`s off the hook

" I Get A Kick Out Of You
My story is much too sad to be told,
 But practically everything leaves me totally cold.
 The only exception I know is the case,
 When I`m out on a quiet spree fightly vainly the old ennui,
 And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face! 
 
 I get no kick from champagne, mere alcohol doesn`t thrill me
 at all,
 So tell me why should it be true, that I get a kick out of you?
 Some get a kick from cocaine, I`m sure that if I took even
 one sniff
 That would bore me terrifically, too, yet I get a kick out of
 you.
 I get a kick every time I see you`re standing there before me.
 I get a kick though it`s clear to me, you obviously don`t
 adore me.
 I get no kick in a plane, flying too high with some gal in the
 sky
 Is my idea of nothing to do, yet I get a kick out of you!

Used to stop and say

Tonight I`m gonna be one happy soul

Gonna rock it up

Gonna shake it up

Gonna load it up

Whoah, at the ball tonight

 

Shake, Rattle and Roll

Writer: Charles Calhoun; lead vocals: John Lennon, Paul McCartney

Well you never do nothing

To save your doggone soul

Well get out of that kitchen

And shake those pots and pans

Step on my face

Slander my name all over the place

Do anything that you want to do

But oh oh honey

Lay off them shoes

Now don`t you step on my blue suede shoes

Well you can do anything

But lay off of them blue suede shoes

Ah go!

You can burn my house

Steal my car

Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar

Do anything that you want to do

But ah ah honey

About the good things that we can have

And go where you`re going to

The ruins of the life that you had in mind

I know your mind`s made up 

You`re gonna cause more misery

And go where you`re going to

Try thinking more if just for your own sake

And you`ve got time to rectify

And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion

Never glimpse the truth-then it's far too late-when they pass away.

We were talking-about the love we all could share-when we find it

To try our best to hold it there-with our love

With our love-we could save the world-if they only knew.

Try to realise it's all within yourself

No-one else can make you change

And to see you're really only very small,

And life flows within you and without you.

We were talking-about the love that's gone so cold and the people,

Who gain the world and lose their soul-

They don't know-they can't see-are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind,

Is waiting there-

And the time will come when you see

we're all one, and life flows on within you and without you.  ",beatles,641

Honey, is there any place that you would like to eat? 
 I know a coffee shop down on Fifty-Second Street 
 And I don`t need no fancy food and I don`t need no fancy wine 
 And I sure don`t need the tears you cry

 Ain`t a very likely place for you and I to meet 
 Watching the snow swirl around your hair and around your feet 
 And I`m thinking to myself she surely looks a treat

It was an filthy block of flats

Trash was on the floor

The stink was in my nose

Hinges off the door



She took me in her room

All was spick and span

Fixed me up a drink

Turned down all the lamps



And the rain fell down

On the cold hard ground

And the phone kept ringing

And we made sweet love



Why do we live in this strange grey town?

They build it up let it all fall down

Feel like we're all living in a battleground

Everybody's jazzed



Why do we live in this strange grey town?

The paint is peeling and the sky's turned brown

The bankers are wankers every Thursday night

they just vomit on the ground



And the rain fell down

On the cold hard ground

And the phone kept ringing

And we made sweet love

And we made sweet love



Everybody's dreaming

Everybody's screaming



Watching the rain fall down



She cooked me up some eggs

Then she made some tea

Kissed me on the check

Then I turned on her tv



It was usual the crap

All the usual sleaze

For 10.000 quid

Some bimbo spilled the beans



And the rain fell down

On the cold hard ground

And the phone kept ringing

And we made sweet love

And we made sweet love  ",stones,641

And decided to take a drive downtown

There was nobody, not a soul around

Tryin' to waste his time

With his methylated sandwich

He's a walking clothesline

She's been an outcast all her life

With his luger in his hand

Standing looking on

With a blood-curdling ""tally-ho""

With their dying breaths screamed, ""Thanks!""

Day after day, alone on a hill

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still

But nobody wants to know him

They can see that he's just a fool

And he never gives an answer



But the fool on the hill

Sees the sun going down

And the eyes in his head

See the world spinning round



Well on the way, head in a cloud,

the man of a thousand voices talking

perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him

Or the sound he appears to make

And he never seems to notice



But the fool on the hill

Sees the sun going down

And the eyes in his head

See the world spinning round



And nobody seems to like him

They can tell what he wants to do

And he never shows his feelings



But the fool on the hill

Sees the sun going down

And the eyes in his head

See the world spinning round



And round, and round, and round, and round, and round ...



He never listens to them

He knows that they're the fools

They don't like him

And the eyes in his head

And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Everywhere, it`s what you make 

For us to take, it`s all too much 

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me 

Makes no difference where you are or where you`d like to be

So take a piece but not too much 

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I`m free 

Show me that I`m everywhere, and get me home for tea 

It`s all to much for me to see 

A love that`s shining all around here 

The more I am, the less I know 

And what I do is all too much 

It`s all too much for me to take

" Within You Without You
We were talking-about the space between us all 

And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion 

Never glimpse the truth-then it`s far too late-when they pass away. 

We were talking-about the love we all could share-when we find it 

To try our best to hold it there-with our love 

With our love-we could save the world-if they only knew. 

Try to realise it`s all within yourself 

No-one else can make you change 

And to see you`re really only very small, 

And life flows within you and without you. 

We were talking-about the love that`s gone so cold and the people, 

Who gain the world and lose their soul- 

They don`t know-they can`t see-are you one of them? 

When you`ve seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind, 

Is waiting there- 

And the time will come when you see 

we`re all one, and life flows on within you and without you.   ",beatles,641

Some are dead and some are living

In my life

I've loved them all



But of all these friends and lovers

There is no one

Compares with you

And these memories lose their meaning

When I think of love

As something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things

That went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life

I love you more



Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things

That went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life

I love you more



Oohh



In my life

I love you more  ",beatles,641
" One After 909
My baby says she`s trav`ling on the one after 909 

I said move over honey I`m travelling on that line 

I said move over once, move over twice 

Come on baby don`t be cold as ice. 

I said I`m trav`ling on the one after 909 I begged her not to 

go and I begged her on my bended knees, 

You`re only fooling around, you`re fooling around with me. 

I said move over once, move over twice 

Come on baby don`t be cold as ice. 

I said I`m trav`ling on the one after 909 

I got my bag, run to the station 

Railman says you`ve got the the wrong location 

I got my bag, run right home 

Then I find I`ve got the number wrong 

Well I said I`m trav`ling on the one after 909 

I said move over honey I`m travelling on that line 

I said move over once, move over twice 

Come on baby don`t be cold as ice. 

I said we`re trav`ling on the one after 9 0, 

I said we`re trav`ling on the one after 9 0, 

I said we`re trav`ling on the one after 909.

The leaves so brown came tumbling down, remember, oh!

" Sleep Tonight
You better get some sleep tonight 
 You better get some sleep tonight 
 Honey, just warn your friends 
 You better get some sleep tonight 
 
 You always watch the sun go down 
 The same old shadows crawl over town 
 Those thoughts of you it shivvers me 
 The moon grows cold in memory 
 
 Baby you better get some sleep tonight 
 All you got to do is close your eyes 
 You better get some sleep tonight 
 
 I wish you baby, all the best 
 If you turn out like all the rest 
 This darkness baby, it`s chilling me 
 Stars store down in sympathy 
 
 Baby you better get some sleep tonight 
 All you got to do is close your eyes 
 Baby you better get some sleep tonight 
 
 You better get some sleep tonight 
 You better get some sleep tonight 
 Warn all your friends 
 You better keep them out of sight 
 You better get some sleep tonight 
 
 They robbed you of your dignity 
 They even steal your heart from me 
 It ain`t revenge, you understand 
 Baby I just want to know who dealth this hand 
 
 Baby, ah that`s alright 
 Baby you better get some sleep tonight 
 All you got to do is close your eyes 
 Baby you better get some sleep tonight
