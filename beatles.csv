How to unfold your love

I don't know how someone controlled you

They bought and sold you.



I look at the world and I notice it's turning

While my guitar gently weeps

With every mistake we must surely be learning

Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted

You were perverted too

I don't know how you were inverted

No one alerted you.

See the play that you're staging

Look at you all,

Doing nothing but aging

I once met a girl,

Or should I say

She once met me.

She showed me her room,

Isn't it good?

Norwegian wood.

She asked my to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,

So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.

I sat on a rug

Biding my time,

Drinking her wine.

We talked until two,

And then she said,

'It's time for bed'.

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh,

I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath.

And when I awoke

I was alone,

This bird has flown,

So I lit a fire,

Isn't it good?

In penny lane there is a barber showing photographs

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.

And all the people that come and go

Stop and say hello.



On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,

The little children laugh at him behind his back.

And the banker never wears a mack

In the pouring rain, very strange.



Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.

There beneath the blue suburban skies

I sit, and meanwhile back



In penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass

And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.

He likes to keep his fire engine clean,

It's a clean machine.



Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.

A four of fish and finger pies

In summer, meanwhile back



Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout

The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray

And tho' she feels as if she's in a play

She is anyway.



In penny lane the barber shaves another customer,

We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.

And then the fireman rushes in

From the pouring rain, very strange.



Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.

There beneath the blue suburban skies

I sit, and meanwhile back.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.

There beneath the blue suburban skies,

Filling in a ticket in her little white book.

In a cap she looked much older,

And the bag across her shoulder

Made her look a little like a military man.

May I inquire discreetly,

Had a laugh and over dinner,

Told her I would really like to see her again,

But now she sucks her thumb and wanders 

By the banks of her own lagoon 

Didn`t anybody tell her? 

Didn`t anybody see? 

Sunday`s on the phone to Monday, 

Tuesday`s on the phone to me 

She said she`d always been a dancer 

She worked at 15 clubs a day 

And though she thought I knew the answer 

Well I knew what I could not say. 

And so I quit the police department 

And got myself a steady job 

And though she tried her best to help me 

She could steal but she could not rob 

Didn`t anybody tell her? 

Didn`t anybody see?

Well, she was just 17,

You know what I mean,

And the way she looked was way beyond compare.

So how could I dance with another (ooh)

When I saw her standin' there.



Well she looked at me, and I, I could see

That before too long I'd fall in love with her.

She wouldn't dance with another (whooh)

When I saw her standin' there.



Well, my heart went ""boom,""

When I crossed that room,

And I held her hand in mine...



Whoah, we danced through the night,

And we held each other tight,

And before too long I fell in love with her.

Now I'll never dance with another (whooh)

Since I saw her standing there.

Wednesday morning at five o'clock

as the day begins

Silently closing her bedroom door

Leaving the note that she hoped would say more

She goes downstairs to the kitchen

clutching her handkerchief

Quietly turning the back door key

Stepping outside she is free



She (we gave her most of our lives)

is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)

home (we gave her everything money could buy)

She's leaving home after living alone for

so many years (bye bye)



Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown

Picks up the letter that's lying there

Standing alone at the top of the stairs

She breaks down and cries to her husband

Daddy our baby's gone

Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly

How could she do this to me

is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)

home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)

so many years (bye bye)



Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away

Waiting to keep the appointment she made

Meeting a man from the motor trade



She (what did we do that was wrong)

is having (we didn't know it was wrong)

fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)

Something inside that was always denied for

so many years (bye bye)

And he began to cry.

Or soothe me when I cry,

[Interlude]

Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me



[Verse 1]

Here come old flat-top, he come grooving up slowly

He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller

He got hair down to his knees

Got to be a joker, he just do what he please



[Interlude]

Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me



[Verse 2]

He wear no shoeshine, he's got toe-jam football

He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola

He say, ""I know you, you know me""

One thing I can tell you is you got to be free



[Chorus]

Come together, right now

Over me



[Verse 3]

He bag production, he got walrus gumboot

He's got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker

He got feet down below his knee

Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease



[Chorus]

Come together, right now

Over me

Right!



[Instrumental break]



[Verse 4]

He roller-coaster, he got early warning

He got muddy water, he one mojo filter

He say, ""One and one and one is three""

Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see

Deep down in Louisianna

Close to New Orleans

Way back up in the woods

Among the evergreens

There stand a country cabin

Made of clay and wood

Where lives a young country boy

Named Johnny B. Goode

He never ever learned

To read or write a book so well

But he could play his guitar

Just like a-ringing a bell 

Go go, go Johnny go go go!

Go Johnny go go go!

Go Johnny go go go!

Go Johnny go go go!

Aah Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar

In a gunny sack

Sit beneath the trees

By the railroad track

Oh sitting and a-playing

In the shade

Drumming to the rhythm

That the drivers made

People passing by

Used to stop and say

My oh my

That country boy can play

Go go, go Johnny go go go!

Go Johnny go go go!

Go Johnny go go go!

Go Johnny go go go!

Aah Johnny B. Goode!

Well his mama told him

Someday you will be a man

And you will be the leader

Of a big old band

Many people coming

From miles around

To hear you play your music

Till the sun goes down

Maybe some day

Your name will be in light

Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!

Go go, go Johnny go go go!

Go Johnny go go go!

Go Johnny go go go!

Go Johnny go go go!

And he never gives an answer

Sees the sun going down

And the eyes in his head

See the world spinning round



Well on the way, head in a cloud,

the man of a thousand voices talking

perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him

Or the sound he appears to make

And he never seems to notice



But the fool on the hill

Sees the sun going down

And the eyes in his head

See the world spinning round



And nobody seems to like him

They can tell what he wants to do

And he never shows his feelings



But the fool on the hill

Sees the sun going down

And the eyes in his head

See the world spinning round



And round, and round, and round, and round, and round ...



He never listens to them

He knows that they're the fools

And with all these friends and lovers

There is no one that compares with you

In our little hideaway beneath the waves

Resting our head, on the sea bed

In an octopus' garden near a cave.



We would sing and dance around

Because we know we can't be found

The coral that lies beneath the waves

Knowing they're happy and they're safe

And though we may be blind,

Love is here to stay.

I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can`t reject. 

I`m changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together 



Who knows, baby, you may comfort me.

Doing the garden, digging the weeds,

Who could ask for more.

In the Isle of Wight, if it`s not too dear

We shall scrimp and save

Indicate precisely what you mean to say

There is no one

Compares with you

Why, why, why, why are we so far apart?

Why, why don`t you open your heart?

If you only knew how much I love you

Why can`t you love me

Why can`t you love me

Why can`t you love me again? Songteksten.net heeft toestemming van Stichting FEMU om deze songtekst te tonen. De songteksten mogen niet anders dan voor prive-gebruik gebruikt worden, iedere andere verspreiding van de songteksten is niet toegestaan."

It`s all too much, It`s all too much 

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me 

And the more I go inside, the more there is to see 

It`s all too much for me to take 

The love that`s shining all around you 

Everywhere, it`s what you make 

For us to take, it`s all too much 

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me 

Makes no difference where you are or where you`d like to be 

It`s all too much for me to take 

The love that`s shining all around here 

All the world`s a birthday cake, 

So take a piece but not too much 

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I`m free 

Show me that I`m everywhere, and get me home for tea 

It`s all to much for me to see 

A love that`s shining all around here 

The more I am, the less I know 

And what I do is all too much 

It`s all too much for me to take 

The love that`s shining all around you 

Everywhere, it`s what you make 

For us to take, it`s all too much

Standing in the dock at Southampton, 

Trying to get to Holland or France. 

The man in the mac said, ""You`ve got to turn back"". 

You know they didn`t even give us a chance. 

Christ you know it ain`t easy, 

You know how hard it can be. 

The way things are going 

They`re going to crucify me. 

Finally made the plane into Paris, 

Honey mooning down by the Seine. 

Peter Brown called to say, 

""You can make it O.K., 

You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"". 

Christ you know it ain`t easy, 

You know how hard it can be. 

The way things are going 

They`re going to crucify me. 

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton, 

Talking in our beds for a week. 

The newspapers said, ""Say what you doing in bed?"" 

I said, ""We`re only trying to get us some peace"". 

Christ you know it ain`t easy, 

You know how hard it can be. 

The way things are going 

They`re going to crucify me. 

Saving up your money for a rainy day, 

Giving all your clothes to charity. 

Last night the wife said, 

""Oh boy, when you`re dead 

You don`t take nothing with you 

But your soul - think!"" 

Made a lightning trip to Vienna, 

eating chocolate cake in a bag. 

The newspapers said, ""She`s gone to his head, 

They look just like two gurus in drag"". 

Christ you know it ain`t easy, 

You know how hard it can be. 

The way things are going 

They`re going to crucify me. 

Caught an early plane back to London. 

Fifty acorns tied in a sack. 

The men from the press said, ""We wish you success, 

It`s good to have the both of you back"". 

Christ you know it ain`t easy, 

You know how hard it can be. 

The way things are going 

They`re going to crucify me.

We were talking-about the space between us all 

And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion 

Never glimpse the truth-then it`s far too late-when they pass away. 

We were talking-about the love we all could share-when we find it 

To try our best to hold it there-with our love 

With our love-we could save the world-if they only knew. 

Try to realise it`s all within yourself 

No-one else can make you change 

And to see you`re really only very small, 

And life flows within you and without you. 

We were talking-about the love that`s gone so cold and the people, 

Who gain the world and lose their soul- 

They don`t know-they can`t see-are you one of them? 

When you`ve seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind, 

Is waiting there- 

And the time will come when you see 

we`re all one, and life flows on within you and without you.  Songteksten.net heeft toestemming van Stichting FEMU om deze songtekst te tonen. De songteksten mogen niet anders dan voor prive-gebruik gebruikt worden, iedere andere verspreiding van de songteksten is niet toegestaan."

Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota 

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon 

And one day his woman ran off with another guy 

Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn`t like that 

He said I`m gonna get that boy 

So one day he walked into town 

Booked himself a room in the local saloon. 

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room 

Only to find Gideon`s bible 

Rocky had come equipped with a gun 

To shoot off the legs of his rival 

His rival it seems had broken his dreams 

By stealing the girl of his fancy. 

Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil 

But everyone knew her as Nancy. 

Now she and her man who called himself Dan 

Were in the next room at the hoe down 

Rocky burst in and grinning a grin 

He said Danny boy this is a showdown 

But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot 

And Rocky collapsed in the corner. 

Now the doctor came in stinking of gin 

And proceeded to lie on the table 

He said Rocky you met your match 

And Rocky said, Doc it`s only a scratch 

And I`ll be better I`ll be better doc as soon as I am able. 

Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room 

Only to find Gideon`s bible 

Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt 

To help with good Rocky`s revival.  Songteksten.net heeft toestemming van Stichting FEMU om deze songtekst te tonen. De songteksten mogen niet anders dan voor prive-gebruik gebruikt worden, iedere andere verspreiding van de songteksten is niet toegestaan."

Fever all through the night.

Oh daddy, won`t you treat him right`

They give you fever when you kiss them

Fever if you live and learn

Fever till you sizzle

We were talking-about the space between us all

And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion

Never glimpse the truth-then it's far too late-when they pass away.

We were talking-about the love we all could share-when we find it

To try our best to hold it there-with our love

With our love-we could save the world-if they only knew.

Try to realise it's all within yourself

No-one else can make you change

And to see you're really only very small,

And life flows within you and without you.

We were talking-about the love that's gone so cold and the people,

Who gain the world and lose their soul-

They don't know-they can't see-are you one of them?

When you've seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind,

Is waiting there-

And the time will come when you see

we're all one, and life flows on within you and without you. Songteksten.net heeft toestemming van Stichting FEMU om deze songtekst te tonen. De songteksten mogen niet anders dan voor prive-gebruik gebruikt worden, iedere andere verspreiding van de songteksten is niet toegestaan."

Helter skelter 

Look out helter skelter 

She`s coming down fast 

Yes she is

Yes I`m lonely wanna die 

Yes I`m lonely wanna die 

If I ain`t dead already 

Ooh girl you know the reason why. 

In the morning wanna die 

In the evening wanna die 

If I ain`t dead already 

Ooh girl you know the reason why. 

My mother was of the sky 

My father was of the earth 

But I am of the universe 

And you know what it`s worth 

I`m lonely wanna die 

If I ain`t dead already 

Ooh girl you know the reason why. 

The eagle picks my eye 

The worm he licks my bone 

I feel so suicidal 

Just like Dylan`s Mr. Jones 

Lonely wanna die 

If I ain`t dead already 

Ooh girl you know the reason why. 

Black cloud crossed my mind 

Blue mist round my soul 

Feel so suicidal 

Even hate my rock and roll 

Wanna die yeah wanna die 

If I ain`t dead already 

Ooh girl you know the reason why.  Songteksten.net heeft toestemming van Stichting FEMU om deze songtekst te tonen. De songteksten mogen niet anders dan voor prive-gebruik gebruikt worden, iedere andere verspreiding van de songteksten is niet toegestaan."

Help, I need somebody,

Help, not just anybody,

Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

I never needed anybody`s help in any way.

But now these days are gone, I`m not so self assured,

Now I find I`ve changed my mind and opened up the doors.



Help me if you can, I`m feeling down

And I do appreciate you being round.

Help me, get my feet back on the ground,

Won`t you please, please help me.



And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,

My independence seems to vanish in the haze.

But every now and then I feel so insecure,

I know that I just need you like I`ve never done before.



Help me if you can, I`m feeling down

And I do appreciate you being round.

Help me, get my feet back on the ground,

Won`t you please, please help me.
